## Planning

As a user you have access to a list of all restaurants considered to be food
food gems.  The list consists of all restaurants supported and recommended by
Phantom Gourmet.  I ultimately wanted the user to view all of the restaurants
individually, and create and leave a review and determine whether the restaurant
was a gem or not. Any user, regardless of the owner of the review, would be able
to index the reviews on the view of the individual restaurant.  I also included
the functionality to delete a review, if you no longer want to have it displayed
under the restaurant. On top of that, I added the option to edit/update your
review.

## Development Process
Overall, things went pretty well and according to my planning at the start of
the project. You'd be able to view a list of all therestaurants you could visit
in New England, these restaurants were accessed through a database seeded with
all the viable restaurants, or "food-gems". I realized within the project, that
a user can index all reviews under the individual restaurant component, as well
as update and or delete them through the component as well.  The fact that
reviews were populated in restaurants really made meeting some requirements
easier.

## Unsolved Problems
No unsolved problems, however, there are features that I simply didn't have
enough time to impliment.


## Future Features
- I wanted to add another component where the user can index all of THEIR reviews
- I also wanted the user to index of the restaurants they thought were Gems
